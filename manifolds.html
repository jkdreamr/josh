            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Let <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}(m, r)\)</span> be an open ball of radius <span class="math">\(r\)</span> centered at <span class="math">\(m \in M\)</span>, a smooth manifold, and consider <span class="math">\(N(m, c, \varepsilon)\)</span>, the number of disjoint congruent balls of radius <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> that can be drawn on <span class="math">\(M\)</span> within <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}(m, c \varepsilon)\)</span> for <span class="math">\(c \geq 3\)</span>. We investigate <span class="math">\(N\)</span> with theoretical methods suggesting that <span class="math">\(N\)</span> will approach a finite upper bound as <span class="math">\(\varepsilon \rightarrow 0\)</span>.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>First, we may look at Euclidean space of familiar dimension (namely 2 and 3) as a basis for investigating other smooth manifolds such as the sphere or torus. There, this question of counting the number of <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-balls that can cover a region on the manifold can be magnified. Since any open patch of <span class="math">\(M^2\)</span> is homeomorphic to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{E}^2\)</span>, we may consider the open <span class="math">\(c \varepsilon\)</span>-ball for <span class="math">\(c \geq 3\)</span> as specified in the problem statement a distorted patch of the Euclidean plane, which has familiar tilings. Notice how, because we can create necessarily invertible charts from <span class="math">\(M\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span> and because smooth manifolds possess complete Riemannian metrics, the Euclidean analogy is not unhelpful. To motivate it further, recall that a packing (of congruent objects) is fully described by its associated set of center points. That is, a circle with fixed radius <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is uniquely identified by the location of its center. The only constraint when generating such a (non-overlapping) packing from a set of centers is that the radius cannot exceed half of the minimum distance between any two points. In <span class="math">\(\mathbb{E}^n\)</span>, however, there are many ways to form a lattice such that every point is necessarily equidistant from all its neighbors. Furthermore, when fully tiling the space with other shapes, one can simply inscribe a ball within that shape, sharing a center point. Consider <span class="math">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>, on which we can pack disks by choosing our set of centers to be <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>. Thus, the line is packed with <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-balls (intervals) with <span class="math">\(\varepsilon=0.5\)</span>. In <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, we can select our set of centers to be every lattice point of the Cartesian grid, allowing us to tile the plane with squares before inscribing circles. Alternatively, we could tile the plane with hexagons (side length 1), still allowing us to pack <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-balls of radius 0.5. Respectively, the densities of these packings are <span class="math">\(\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{12}}\)</span> (in two dimensions, the hexagonal lattice does provide the densest circle packing).</p>

            <h2>Stereographic Projection</h2>
            <p>Considering this question as raised with <span class="math">\(M=S^2\)</span>, we can imagine a stereographic projection of the sphere onto the Euclidean plane, which is a conformal mapping that will therefore preserve (locally) shapes. If <span class="math">\(S^2\)</span> is the unit sphere centered at the origin and with pole <span class="math">\(p=(0,0,1)\)</span>, then the projective map may be represented by</p>
            <p><span class="math">\(\chi: S^2 \backslash\{p\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2\)</span></p>
            <p>and defined with</p>
            <p><span class="math">\(\chi(m)=\left(\frac{x}{1-z}, \frac{y}{1-z}\right)\)</span>.</p>
            <p>Its inverse <span class="math">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span> is then given by</p>
            <p><span class="math">\(\chi^{-1}(x, y)=\left(\frac{2x}{x^2+y^2+1}, \frac{2y}{x^2+y^2+1}, \frac{x^2+y^2-1}{x^2+y^2+1}\right)\)</span>,</p>
            <p>allowing us to project from the plane onto the sphere. If we are to project a patch of <span class="math">\(S^2\)</span> in the shape of an open <span class="math">\(c \varepsilon\)</span>-ball onto <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, create a lattice <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\)</span> on that patch which optimizes <span class="math">\(N(m, c, \varepsilon)\)</span>, then return it to the sphere via <span class="math">\(\chi^{-1}\)</span>, there is now a deformed patch of the plane that contains already a packing of disks with maximal density.</p>

            <h2>Contact Graphs</h2>
            <p>Perhaps to avoid charts altogether, we may construct a different type of translation. Consider, within <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}(m, c \varepsilon)\)</span>, the number and orientation of disjoint, congruent <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-balls in a packing that maximizes <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. The simple graph whose vertices are these balls and whose edges represent the contact of the vertices they connect is called the contact graph of the packing. As <span class="math">\(\varepsilon \rightarrow 0\)</span>, the number of vertices on this graph will increase, but not without bound. Just as <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}(m, c \varepsilon)\)</span> restricts the balls to scale with its own radius, the number of vertices of the graph is restricted by the number of edges. Every time a new vertex is added, it must be connected with at least one edge (even in low-density packings this number is still much larger than 1).</p>
